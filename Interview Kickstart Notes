Always aim for Product Tech companies - they are fundamentally different from other companies.
Early engineers - 125k-200k, mid -level- 200k-300k, Management - 300k$ + salaries, these salaries are paid everywhere on east or west coast
Moving to management is always a choice! 
IK-Interview Kickstart - Works with alumni of 15000 engineers and hiring managers- from 2-3yrs experience to 20yrs experience
IK Platform is developer by actual hiring managers- technical recruiters from the top companies.

Three things IK try to eliminate - flexible for time, multiple payment structures - boost up- less than a month to prepare, step up- couple of months to prepare, 
level up-3-4 months-built around live classes  and switch up- if you want to switch into a completely new domain-three courses- ML, Data science backend and Full stack.

They develop a curriculum - by start talking to actual companies -to see what should one do to be incredibly well prepared for an interview.
